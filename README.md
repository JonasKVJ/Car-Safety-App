# Car Safety App

This is a short multiple choice demo app, which was made to help any car driver with determining what constitutes car safety and how to achieve it, although the project is very much a prototype. The demo was finished independently without any kind of feedback, and took around 20 hours to complete. This project was only for personal practice, and is not in active development, so the code quality is not the best! Design patterns should have been applied, the UI needs complete rework, the app needs to be scalable. Best practices for Android app development were not followed. The concept and structure would also need complete rework, as it does not match the form of apps on the market.
