# Car Safety App

Warning: this project contains low quality unfinished code! 

This is a short multiple choice demo app, which was made to help any car driver with determining what constitutes car safety and how to achieve it, although the project is very much a prototype. The demo was finished independently without any kind of feedback, and took around 20 hours to complete. This project was only for personal practice, and is not in active development, so the code quality is not the best! Possible improvements: design patterns, UI, restructuring of app, code quality, adherence to Android app best practices.
